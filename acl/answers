Dear reviewers,

Before answering your questions, we would like to thank you for the time you spent reviewing our paper.

Reviewer #1
-----------

- "their approach only combines the keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment method. The novelty is marginal and the contribution of the work is not remarkable."

We do not "only" perform a combination of both approaches. We integrate the concepts of both approaches within the unified graph and let the co-ranking algorithm decides. Also, we specifically present a system that do not use rules to give a prior to one or another approach.

- "Some detail mistake"

Please note that the mistakes have been removed. We also asked a native English speaker to check our paper.

Reviewer #2:
------------

- "Controlled keyphrase candidates are connected to an automatically extracted topic (or keyphrase) only when the controlled keyphrase candidates have common substring with the automatically extracted keyphrase. [...] According to authors, the controlled keyphrases do not have to appear in a document to which the keyphrases are assigned. But the above requirement on common substrings seems to reduce the chance that such "absent" keyphrases are highly ranked."

The subgraph containing the controlled keyphrase candidates also contains links between the controlled keyphrrase candidates. Therefore, and due to the voting concept, a controlled keyphrase candidate not connected to a node of the other subgraph can be assigned.

- "low precision, recall and F-measures in their experimental results (less than 30 in most cases.) I'm not sure if the comparison of such low level performance figures are actually meaningful."

Current performances on the keyphyrase extraction/assignment task do not perform higher that 30% in most cases, especially scientific documents.

Reviewer #3:
------------

"As the authors mention, the overall idea of constructing a graph and using measures like Page Rank, etc. for scoring nodes by importance is a well-studied technique."

However, we are the first to propose a co-ranking approach that leverages the domain knowledge, represented by the controlled keyphrases.

Again, thank you.
