  \begin{abstract}
  Keyphrases are words or phrases that synthesize the content of a document.
  In previous work, automatic keyphrase annotation is either carried out 
  by extracting the most important phrases from a document (keyphrase 
  extraction), or by assigning entries from a controlled vocabulary 
  (keyphrase assignment).
  On the one hand, assignment methods provide better-formed keyphrases, 
  as well as keyphrases that do not occur in the document.
  On the other hand, extraction methods do not depend on manually built 
  resources and are able to provide new (not already assigned) keyphrases.
  This paper proposes a co-ranking approach that performs keyphrase 
  extraction and assignment simultaneously in a mutually reinforcing manner.
  Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach 
  for the two tasks, both individually and combined.
  
  

%    Keyphrases are words or phrases that %represent the most important
%    reflects the content of a document. 
    %soit phrase soit multi-word expressions mais pas mulit-word
%    Keyphrase extraction deals with the selection of keyphrases that occur 
%    in the document. %consists in annotating a document with the important concepts verbatim in the document. 
%    Keyphrase assignment deals with the assignation of keyphrases that are term entries of a thesausus to the document.  These keyphrases may not occur in the document as such.
    %consists in annotating a document with terminological entries,
    %not necessarily verbatim in the document, that describe the important
    %concepts in the document. 
    %The former approach 
%    Keyphrase extraction is able to discover new terms that are not yet in a reference or a thesaurus, whereas keyphrase assignment provides better-formed keyphrases. 
%    This paper presents the first method, TopicCoRank,  %to simultaneously j'aime pas ce mot
%    that performs keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment in parallel. 
    %ou the first integrated method that performs both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment
    %Our method 
%    TopicCoRank uses a co-occurrence graph 
    %of the document and its domain, and
%    built from the document and from prior terminological knowledge 
    %unified them 
%    to rank document and terminological keyphrase candidates.
    % tu peux choisir entre domain et terminological (terminological inclut la notion de domaine)
    % Une phrase avec les résutats genre We demonstrate on several datasets and languages that TopiCoRank outperforms keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment.
