  \maketitle
  \begin{abstract}
    Keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying single or multi-word
    expressions that best represent the content of a document. A wide range of
    methods are proposed to automatically extract keyphrases. Regardless the
    differences between them, we observe common steps. Among these steps, the
    most important ones are the extraction of keyphrase candidates and the
    classification, or ranking. Many methods about the core problem of
    classifying, or ranking, the keyphrase candidates are proposed, but no work
    has been done to analyse the impact of the various candidate extraction
    methods. In this paper, we present the common candidate
    extraction methods and suggest the use of a term extraction method. To show
    their impact on the keyphrase extraction
    task, we compare the candidate sets extracted by each method and analyse the
    results obtained with different keyphrase extraction methods.
