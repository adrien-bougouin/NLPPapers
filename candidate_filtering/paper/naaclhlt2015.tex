  \begin{abstract}
    Keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying single or multi-word
    expressions that best represent the content of a document. Most automatic
    keyphrase extraction methods rely on a candidate selection step, in which
    only the textual units that have similar properties to keyphrases are kept.
    Candidate selection therefore plays an important role in keyphrase
    extraction since it determines the upper bound of recall performance. In
    this paper, we infer two general keyphrase properties, we discuss the
    consistency of commonly used methods for candidate selection and we
    demonstrate that it can be improved by filtering out irrelevant adjectives
    from keyphrase candidates. Through experiments carried out on three standard
    datasets of different languages and domains, we show that, in most cases,
    filtering out adjectives judged to be of no use to the meaning of keyphrase
    candidates improves the performance of both supervised and unsupervised
    keyphrase extraction methods.
