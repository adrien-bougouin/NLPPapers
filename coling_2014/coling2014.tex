  \begin{abstract}
    Keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying single or multi-word
    expressions that best represent the content of a document. Most automatic
    keyphrase extraction methods rely on a candidate selection step, in which
    only the textual units that have similar properties to keyphrases are kept.
    Candidate selection therefore plays an important role in keyphrase
    extraction since it determines the upper bound of recall performance. In
    this paper, we compare three commonly used methods for candidate selection
    and propose a new approach that generates refined noun phrases by filtering
    out irrelevant adjective modifiers. Through experiments carried out on three
    standard datasets of different languages and domains, we show that our
    approach reduces the number of selected candidates and improves keyphrase
    extraction performance when used with either supervised or unsupervised
    methods.
