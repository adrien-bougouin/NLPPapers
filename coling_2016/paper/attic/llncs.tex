    Keyphrase annotation is the task of identifying textual units that represent the main content of a document.
    Automatic keyphrase annotation methods fall into two disjoint categories: extraction, which outputs keyphrases directly from the textual units within the content of the document; and assignment, which identifies keyphra\-ses controlled by domain-specific vocabularies.
    Many keyphrase extraction methods have been proposed, whereas keyphrase assignment methods have rarely been proposed. %because of assignment difficulty compared to extraction.
    However, keyphrase-based document indexing for Digital Libraries requires both categories of methods.

    In this paper, we apply the concept of co-ranking for simultaneously extracting and assigning keyphrases from a graph combining document topics and domain-specific keyphrases.
    This approach leverages the global context --- the domain --- of the document to better extract key\-phrases from the topics, and the local context --- the document --- of domain-specific keyphrases to better assign keyphrases that cannot be extracted from the document.
    To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to simultaneously perform both keyphrase extraction and assignment.
    Experiments on three evaluation datasets show statistically significant improvements in f1-score compared to state-of-the-art results.

%    Keyphrases are words or phrases that summarize the content of a document.
%    In previous work, automatic keyphrase annotation is either carried out 
%    by extracting the most important phrases from a document (keyphrase 
%    extraction), or by assigning entries from controlled vocabulary 
%   (keyphrase assignment).
%    On the one hand, assignment methods provide better-formed keyphrases, 
%   as well as keyphrases that do not occur in the document.
%    On the other hand, extraction methods do not depend on manually built 
%    resources and are able to provide new (not already assigned) keyphrases.
%    This paper proposes a new method that uses graph co-ranking to perform both
%    keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment, in a mutual reinforcing manner.
%    Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
%    outperforms both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment baselines.
