  \begin{abstract}
    Keyphrase annotation is the task of identifying textual units that represent the main content of a document.
    %
    Keyphrase annotation is either carried out by extracting the most important phrases from a document, keyphrase extraction, or by assigning entries from a controlled domain-specific vocabulary, keyphrase assignment.
    %
    Assignment methods are generally more reliable.
    %
    They provide better-formed keyphrases, as well as keyphrases that do not occur in the document.
    %
    But they are often silent on the contrary of extraction methods that do not depend on manually built resources.
    %
    This paper proposes a new method to perform both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment in an integrated and mutual reinforcing manner.
    %
    Experiments have been carried out on datasets covering different domains of humanities and social sciences.
    %
    They show statistically significant improvements compared to both keyphrase extraction and keyphrase assignment state-of-the art methods.
