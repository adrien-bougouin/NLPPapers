  \begin{abstract}
    Keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying single or multi-word
    expressions that best represent the content of a document. Keyphrases are
    synthetic textual units. Therefore, keyphrases are used in many natural
    language processing tasks and the automatic keyphrase extraction is an
    active field of research. Many methods about the core problem of classifying
    or ranking keyphrase candidates are proposed, but no work has been done to
    analyse the impact of the various methods to extract keyphrase candidates.
    In this paper, we present the common candidate extraction methods, we
    propose to use a term extraction method to extract candidates, we compare
    the extracted candidates of each method and we analyse their impact on
    relatively different keyphrase extraction methods.
