\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:section}
  Keyphrases are single or multi-word expressions that represent the main topics
  of a document. Keyphrases are useful in many tasks such as information
  retrieval~\cite{medelyan2008smalltrainingset}, document
  summarization~\cite{litvak2008graphbased} or document
  clustering~\cite{han2007webdocumentclustering}. Although scientific articles
  usually provide them, most of the documents have no associated keyphrases.
  Therefore, the problem of automatically assigning keyphrases to documents is
  an active field of research.

  Automatic keyphrase extraction methods are divided into two categories:
  supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods typically recast
  keyphrase extraction as a binary classification
  task~\cite{witten1999kea,sujian2003maximumentropy,eichler2010keywe}. For
  unsupervised methods, keyphrase extraction is often considered as a ranking
  task and many approaches are
  used~\cite{barker2000nounphrasehead,tomokiyo2003languagemodel,mihalcea2004textrank}.
  As distinct as they are, both supervised and unsupervised methods rely on a
  preliminary candidate extraction step which identifies single and multi-word
  expressions that have the same syntactic properties than a keyphrase. These
  expressions are the only textual units that can be extracted as keyphrases.
  
  In this paper, we focus on the candidate extraction step and show its impact
  on the performance of automatic keyphrase extraction. Various methods
  are commonly employed to extract keyphrase candidates. Usually, a set of
  either single words, n-grams filtered by stop words, NP-chunks or sequences of
  words matching given patterns is extracted~\cite{hulth2003keywordextraction}.
  According to the chosen method, the extracted set contains more or less
  candidates, and the amount of these that match with the ground truth
  keyphrases may vary. Hence, a few questions arise. How the different sets
  influence the keyphrase extraction? Do large candidate sets introduce noise
  that affects the performance of some keyphrase extraction methods?

  We seek to better understand the impact of candidate extraction methods on
  keyphrase extraction by studying the aforementioned questions. We first
  quantify the differences between the candidate sets obtained by the commonly
  used methods. Also, we propose to use another method developed to extract
  noun-phrases for document indexing~\cite{evans1996nounphraseanalysis} and we
  argue that such term detection
  method~\cite{castellvi2001automatictermdetection} provides solid keyphrase
  candidates. Then, we evaluate the impact of the candidate extraction methods
  on three dissimilar keyphrase extraction methods. We select
  KEA~\cite{witten1999kea} to represent supervised methods,
  TF-IDF~\cite{jones1972tfidf} to represent unsupervised methods that require a
  collection of documents and TopicRank~\cite{bougouin2013topicrank} to
  represent unsupervised methods that only make use of the document to analyse.
