\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:section}
  Keyphrases are single or multi-word expressions that represent the main topics
  of a document. Keyphrases are useful in many tasks such as information
  retrieval~\cite{medelyan2008smalltrainingset}, document
  summarization~\cite{litvak2008graphbased} or document
  clustering~\cite{han2007webdocumentclustering}. Since the last decade,
  Internet has became the main source of information, but the available
  documents are not always associated with keyphrases and the enrichment
  provided by the mentioned tasks cannot be achieved. To allow these
  enrichments, researchers tend to automatically extract keyphrases from
  documents.

  Automatic keyphrase extraction methods are divided into two categories:
  supervised and unsupervised methods. Supervised methods typically recast the
  keyphrase extraction as a binary classification task~\cite{witten1999kea}.
  For unsupervised methods, keyphrase extraction is often considered as a
  ranking task and many approaches are
  used~\cite{barker2000nounphrasehead,mihalcea2004textrank}. Although they work
  differently, both supervised and unsupervised methods rely on a preliminary
  candidate extraction step. The candidate extraction identifies single and
  multi-word expressions that have the same syntactic properties than a
  keyphrase. These expressions are the only textual units that can be extracted
  as keyphrases. Therefore, keyphrase candidates play an important role for
  automatic keyphrase extraction.
  
  In this paper, we focus on the candidate extraction step. Various methods are
  commonly employed to extract keyphrase candidates. Usually, filtered n-grams,
  NP-chunks or word sequences matching given patterns are
  extracted~\cite{hulth2003keywordextraction}. Despite the fact that some
  researchers try to find more suitable keyphrase
  candidates~\cite{hulth2003keywordextraction,kim2009reexaminingautomatickeyphraseextraction},
  there is, in our knowledge, no work to compare the various methods which are
  used. We seek to do this by comparing the performances of existing keyphrase
  extraction methods depending on the employed candidate extraction and by
  looking at the amount of extracted candidates and the maximum recall that can
  be achieved for each. Also, we investigate the feasibility of using term as
  candidate keyphrases. Terms are grammatically arranged sequences of words
  designating a concept and treated as single units, namely terminological
  phrases. Therefore, terms seem to be suitable for keyphrase candidate
  extraction.

  This paper is organized as follows.
  Section~\ref{sec:definition_of_candidate_keyphrases} presents our datasets and
  study their reference keyphrases, Section~\ref{sec:candidate_extraction}
  presents the candidate extraction and term extraction methods and
  Section~\ref{sec:keyphrase_extraction} describes the three keyphrase
  extraction methods that we use in our evaluations presented in
  Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}. Finally,
  Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} conclude this work.

\section{Definition of Candidate Keyphrases}
\label{sec:definition_of_candidate_keyphrases}
  Candidate keyphrases are textual units which can be selected as keyphrases
  of a document. Therefore, they must have the same syntactic properties than
  ground truth keyphrases. This section aims to determine those properties by
  analyzing three standard evaluation datasets.

  \subsection{Keyphrase Extraction Datasets}
  \label{subsec:keyphrase_extraction_datasets}
    Keyphrase extraction datasets are used to train or evaluate methods for
    keyphrase extraction. They are collections of documents paired with
    reference keyphrases given by authors, readers or both. In this work, we use
    three standard datasets which differ in terms of document size,  type and
    language.

    The \textbf{DUC} dataset \cite{over2001duc} is a collection of 308 English
    news articles covering about 30 topics (e.g. tornadoes, gun control, etc.).
    This collection is the test dataset of the DUC-2001 summarization evaluation
    campaign. This part of DUC-2001 is the only one that contains keyphrases,
    annotated by \newcite{wan2008expandrank}. We split the collection into two
    sets: a training set containing 208 documents and a test set containing 100
    documents.

    The \textbf{SemEval} dataset \cite{kim2010semeval} contains 284 English
    scientific papers collected from the ACM Digital Libraries (conference and
    workshop papers). The papers are divided into three sets: a trial set
    containing 40 documents (unused in this work), a training set containing 144
    documents and a test set containing 100 documents. The associated keyphrases
    are provided by both authors and readers.

    The \textbf{DEFT} dataset \cite{Paroubek2012deft} is a collection of 234
    French scientific papers belonging to the Humanities and Social Sciences
    domain. DEFT is divided into two sets: a training set containing 141
    documents and a test set containing 93 documents. References are author
    keyphrases.

  \subsection{Reference Keyphrases Analysis}
  \label{subsec:keyphrase_analysis}
    Despite the fact that the data are not homogeneous, this section aims to
    find the syntactic properties of most keyphrases for English and French. To
    avoid from biasing our evaluations we only exploit information from the
    training data.

    Table~\ref{tab:train_dataset_statistics} shows statistics extracted from our
    datasets. It represents information about the documents (language, nature,
    size, etc.) and their associated keyphrases. First, keyphrases are studied
    regarding their number of words, which is a clue about their degree of
    informativity. Secondly, the amount of multi-word keyphrases containing a
    potentially relevant part-of-speech (POS) is given to allow us to infer
    syntactic properties of keyphrases\footnote{We know that word keyphrases are
    mostly nouns or proper nouns, so we focus on multi-word expressions.}. In
    this purpose, reference keyphrases have been automatically POS tagged and
    manually checked.

               French keyphrases. \label{tab:best_patterns}}
    \end{table*}

    Keyphrase statistics of Table~\ref{tab:train_dataset_statistics} show that
    most of the keyphrases are unigrams or bigrams ($\simeq$~$80\%$). Also, the
    number of n-gram keyphrases decreases when $n$ increases ($n\geq3$). We
    conclude that keyphrases are more often less informative.
    
    \begin{property}\label{prop:informativity}
      Keyphrases bear the minimum information representing an important concept
      (e.g. ``T-2 Buckeye'' instead of ``two-seat T-2 Buckeye'').
    \end{property}

    Table~\ref{tab:train_dataset_statistics} shows the ratio of multi-word
    keyphrases containing a part-of-speech that is intuitively relevant for
    keyphrases. In both English and French, almost every keyphrases contain
    nouns and half of the keyphrases are modified by one or more adjectives. In
    French, we also observe that some keyphrases tend to contain prepositions
    and determiners. Additionally, unexpected part-of-speech, such as foreign,
    are not rare in French.

    \begin{property}\label{prop:noun_phrases}
      Keyphrases are mostly nouns (e.g. ``storms'') that can be modified by one
      or more adjectives (e.g. ``\underline{annual} hurricane forecast'').
      French keyphrases containing multiple nouns can contain prepositions and
      determiners (e.g. ``conservation \underline{de la} nature'' -- ``nature
      conservation'').
    \end{property}

    To give an idea of the observed syntactic patterns,
    Table~\ref{tab:best_patterns} shows the five most frequent POS tag patterns
    for English and French.

\section{Candidate Extraction}
\label{sec:candidate_extraction}
  The goal of the candidate extraction is to reduce the potential keyphrases to
  a set of relevant ones. Two benefits in reducing the possibilities are that it
  diminishes the execution time of the keyphrase extraction methods and removes
  noises that may deteriorate their results. We distinguish two categories of
  candidates: the positive candidates, which actually match with reference
  keyphrases, and the off-target candidates, which do not match with reference
  keyphrases. Among the off-target candidates, we also distinguish the
  information bearing candidates, which can help to improve the keyphrase
  extraction, and the unrelevant candidates, which are seen as extraction
  errors.

  In this section, we present the common textual units that are used or could be
  used as candidates for keyphrase extraction.

  \paragraph{N-grams} are ordered sequences of $n$ words. From a text, every
  sequences of a given size $n$ are extracted. This is the best way to obtain as
  much positive or information bearing candidates as possible, but it also gives
  many unrelevant candidates. Therefore, the extracted candidates are filtered
  with a list of stop words: conjunctions, prepositions, determiners  and common
  words. According to \newcite{witten1999kea} stop words must not be found at
  the beginning or at the end of a candidate.

  \paragraph{POS tag patterns} are used to specify the syntactic form of the
  textual units to extract as keyphrases. \newcite{hulth2003keywordextraction}
  experiments with the frequent POS tag patterns of her training
  data\footnote{Frequent patterns are the ones that appear ten or more times.},
  whereas most researchers use the longest sequences of nouns, proper nouns and
  adjectives, namely the longest NPs.

  \paragraph{NP-chunks} are non-recursive noun phrases, i.e. noun phrases that
  do not contain other noun phrases. \newcite{hulth2003keywordextraction} uses
  them in her experiments and argues that they are less arbitrary -- which is
  the case of n-grams -- and, most of all, more linguistic. Also, such minimal
  noun phrases are consistent with both Property~\ref{prop:informativity} and
  Property~\ref{prop:noun_phrases}.

  \paragraph{Terminological phrases (terms)} are word sequences designating a
  concept and treated as single units for a specific domain. Considering that a
  keyphrase is the vector of an idea, or a concept, it seems relevant to extract
  keyphrases from  a set of terminological phrases. Besides, extracting
  terminological phrases as keyphrase candidates is not arbitrary and
  linguistically justified.

  TermSuite\footnote{\url{http://www.ttc-project.eu}} is a term extraction
  system that we propose to use for keyphrase candidate extraction. TermSuite is
  a tool for monolingual and bilingual term extraction that implements the
  state-of-the-art method for term extraction and term variant detection.

  Additionally, in their review of automatic term extraction methods,
  \newcite{castellvi2001automatictermdetection} stated that alongside term
  extraction there is the document indexing task. Indeed, the textual units that
  index a given document, i.e. best describe its content, often are
  terminological phrases. Hence, we believe that the complex noun phrase
  sub-compounding method of \newcite{evans1996nounphraseanalysis} could be
  suitable for keyphrase candidate extraction. The aim of their method is to
  extract both highly informative and less informative terms. Highly informative
  terms are complex noun phrases (e.g. ``the quality of surface of treated
  stainless steel strip'') and less  informative terms are their meaningful
  sub-compounds. Four types of sub-compounds are defined:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item{Lexical atoms, i.e. semantically coherent phrases (e.g. ``stainless
          steel'')
          \label{item:lexical_atom}}
    \item{Head modifier pairs (e.g. ``treated steel)
          \label{item:head_modifier}}
    \item{Cross preposition modification pairs (e.g. ``surface quality'')
          \label{item:cross_preposition_modifier}}
    \item{Sub-compounds (e.g. ``stainless steel strip'')
          \label{item:subcompound}}
  \end{enumerate}
  The \ref{item:lexical_atom}$^\text{st}$,
  \ref{item:cross_preposition_modifier}$^\text{rd}$ and
  \ref{item:subcompound}$^\text{th}$ types represent continuous textual units,
  whereas the \ref{item:head_modifier}$^\text{nd}$ type represents both
  continuous and discontinuous textual units. In our work, we do not consider
  the head modifiers (\ref{item:head_modifier}), because we aim to only extract
  keyphrases contained in the analyzed document. For the same reason, we do not
  generate cross preposition modification pairs
  (\ref{item:cross_preposition_modifier}), which are not always contained within
  the document.

\section{Keyphrase Extraction}
\label{sec:keyphrase_extraction}
  The keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying single or multi-word
  expressions that best represent a document. After the extraction of the
  keyphrase candidates, an unsupervised or supervised method is applied to,
  respectively, rank or classify the candidates. Unsupervised methods do not
  need a human intervention, they may need a collection of non-annotated
  documents (TF-IDF), a set of similar
  documents~\cite[ExpandRank]{wan2008expandrank} or only the analyzed
  document~\cite[TopicRank]{bougouin2013topicrank}. As for supervised methods,
  such as KEA~\cite{witten1999kea}, they need manually annotated data to learn
  what are keyphrases. Supervised methods usually achieve better results than
  unsupervised methods.

  In this section, we present the three keyphrase extraction methods that we
  retain for our work. The first method uses a collection of non-annotated
  documents (TF-IDF), the second method only needs the analyzed document
  (TopicRank) and the last method requires annotated documents for a prior
  training (KEA).

  \paragraph{TF-IDF} is a weighting scheme that represents the significance of a
  word in a given document. A significant word must be both frequent in the
  document (TF) and specific to it (IDF). The specificity is determined using a
  collection of documents. The intuition is that the lower is the amount of
  documents containing a word, the higher is the specificity of the word.

  The keyphrase candidates are scored according to the sum of the TF-IDF weight
  of their words and the $k$ keyphrases with the highest scores are extracted as
  keyphrases.

  \paragraph{TopicRank} aims to extract keyphrases that best represent the main
  topics of a document. One keyphrase is extracted from each of the $k$ most
  significant topics, leading to a set of topically unredundant keyphrases.

  First, the keyphrase candidates are clustered by topic, assuming that
  candidates sharing enough words belong to the same topic. Secondly, the
  topics are used as graph nodes linked altogether. The TextRank graph-based
  ranking is then applied to rank the topics according to the strength of their
  links. The smaller are the offset distances between the candidates of two
  topics, the higher is the strength between the two topics. A topic strongly
  connected to many topics is highly significant and gives more significancy to
  every topic it is connected to. Finally, the most significant topics are
  selected and one candidate per each is chosen as a keyphrase. Assuming that a
  topic is first introduced by its generic form, the best keyphrase candidate
  for a topic is the one that appears first into the document.

  \paragraph{KEA} is a supervised keyphrase extraction method that learns to
  identify keyphrases based on two features. Indeed, a training collection is
  used to compute probabilities to have keyphrases given specific TF-IDF
  weights\footnote{The TF-IDF weights computed for KEA are based on the
  candidate frequency, not word frequency.} and specific first positions of
  candidates. A Naive Bayes classifier make usage of the two learned
  distributions (TF-IDF and first position) to classify the keyphrase candidates
  extracted from an analyzed document.

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
  To better understand the candidate extraction methods, we perform two
  evaluations. The first evaluation shows the quantity of extracted candidates
  compared to the quantity of extracted positive candidates. The second
  evaluation compares the candidate extraction method when they are used with
  either TF-IDF, TopicRank or KEA.

  \subsection{Datasets}
  \label{subsec:datasets}
    The datasets used to evaluate the methods are the test sets of DUC,
    SemEval and DEFT (see Section~\ref{subsec:keyphrase_extraction_datasets}).
    Table~\ref{tab:test_dataset_statistics} reports the information about these
    test sets. As they are coherent with the training sets, we can make usage of
    the properties inferred in
    Section~\ref{sec:definition_of_candidate_keyphrases}.

    This section presents the intrinsic evaluation of the candidate extraction
    methods presented in Section~\ref{sec:candidate_extraction}. The aim is to
    compare the methods in terms of quantity of extracted candidates and
    percentage of keyphrases that can be found.

    \subsubsection{Method Settings}
    \label{subsubsec:method_settings}
      The parameters of the keyphrase candidate extraction methods are chosen to
      fit as much as possible the keyphrase properties inferred from the
      training sets (see Section~\ref{sec:definition_of_candidate_keyphrases}).

      According to Property~\ref{prop:informativity}, we try two \textbf{n-gram
      extraction} methods with low $n$ values: the first method extracts
      filtered n-grams where $n \in \{1..2\}$ and the second method extracts
      filtered n-grams where $n \in \{1..3\}$. The stop words used for the
      filtering are part of the IR Multilingual Resources provided by the
      University of Neuch√¢tel (UniNE).

      We define two \textbf{pattern matching} methods. The first one learns the
      keyphrase POS tag patterns from the training documents and extracts
      textual units (filtered by stop words) that match one of the patterns. The
      second method follows both Property~\ref{prop:noun_phrases} and previous
      works on keyphrase extraction by looking for the longest sequences of
      nouns and adjectives, supposedly the longest noun phrases.

      The \textbf{NP-chunk extraction} is performed using pattern matching. Only
      basic regular expressions are used:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item{(Np+) $|$~(A+~Nc) $|$~(Nc+), for English}
        \item{(Np+) $|$~(A?~Nc~A+) $|$~(A~Nc) $|$~(Nc+),
              for French}
      \end{itemize}

      The \textbf{sub-compounding} method of
      \newcite{evans1996nounphraseanalysis} requires complex noun phrases. For
      comparison purpose, we input the longest NPs extracted by pattern
      matching and assum that they are complex NPs.

      \textbf{TermSuite} is used to build a terminology for each training
      dataset. The terminologies contain 30807 terms for DUC, 76597 terms for
      SemEval or 123796 terms for DEFT.

    \subsubsection{Result Analysis}
    \label{subsubsec:candidate_extraction_result_analysis}
      Table~\ref{tab:candidate_extraction_statistics} shows the number of
      textual units extracted by each candidate extraction method and indicates
      the maximum recall that could be achieved, i.e. the percentage of
      reference keyphrases that could eventually be found.

      Globally, the extraction  of n-grams gives many candidates and allows a
      high maximum recall, whereas the extraction of more specific textual units
      provides few candidates and allows a lower maximum recall. However, for
      the extraction of the longest noun phrases, NP-chunks and the longest noun
      phrases plus their sub-compounds, the drop in the maximum recall is not
      significant compared to the drop in the number of candidates. At this
      point, we can say that it benefits the processing time by avoiding
      off-target candidates and it is not excluded that the avoided off-target
      candidates are unrelevant candidates which may introduce noise that
      dampens the keyphrase extraction performances. Also, the extraction of
      textual units matching learned patterns seems to stand as a compromise
      between the extraction of n-grams and the extraction of the longest NPs,
      NP-chunks or longest NPs plus their sub-compounds.

      The addition of sub-compounds to the longest NPs does not seem to improve.
      Indeed, a few candidates are added and the maximum recall barely
      increases. This means that the longest NPs already are less informative
      textual units. Therefore, according to Property~\ref{prop:informativity},
      the longest NPs are suitable keyphrase candidates. Adding sub-compounds to
      them might not significantly increase the performances of keyphrase
      extraction methods.

      TermSuite provides a few candidates and do not allow a good maximum
      recall. Figure~\ref{fig:candidate_intersections} compares TermSuite
      candidates with two candidate sets that allow a decent maximum recall
      while providing either many or few candidates: respectively
      $\{1..3\}$-grams and longest NPs. Almost every positive candidates
      extracted by TermSuite are also extracted by the other methods, which
      extract even more positive candidates. Therefore, the only reason why
      TermSuite candidates could help to better extract keyphrases is the
      quality of the candidates. In fact, the $\{1..3\}$-grams may cover almost
      all the TermSuite candidates, but it extract so much arbitrary candidates
      that the risk of introducing noise dampening performances is increased. In
      the contrary TermSuite candidates do not significantly overlap the longest
      NPs. At this point, we can not decide whether one candidate set is better
      than the other. It is also not excluded that the two sets are
      complementary.

  \subsection{Keyphrase Extraction}
  \label{subsec:keyphrase_extraction}
    This section presents the extrinsic evaluation of the keyphrase candidate
    extraction methods. The performances of TF-IDF, TopicRank and KEA are
    compared when they extract keyphrases from each candidate set.

    \subsubsection{Evaluation Measures}
    \label{subsubsec:keyphrase_extraction_evaluation_measures}
      The performances of TF-IDF, TopicRank and KEA are evaluated in terms of
      precision, recall and f-score (f1-measure) when a maximum of 10 keyphrases
      are extracted. To allow morphological variations and reduce the missing
      keyphrases problem, extracted keyphrases and reference keyphrases are
      compared using stemmed forms.

    \subsubsection{Result Analysis}
    \label{subsubsec:candidate_extraction_result_analysis}
      Tables~\ref{tab:tfidf_results},~\ref{tab:topicrank_results}~and~\ref{tab:kea_results}
      show the performances of respectively TF-IDF, TopicRank and KEA when
      they are applied with either one of the studied candidate extraction
      methods.

      Globally, for every method the best performances are achieved when using
      matching patterns (learned patterns, longest NPs, NP-chunks, etc.). As
      suggested in Section~\ref{subsubsec:candidate_extraction_result_analysis},
      despite the fact they provide a low number of candidates and allow a lower
      maximum recall compared to the extraction of n-grams, these methods
      provide better quality candidate sets by avoiding unrelevant candidates.

      Most of the time, the longest NPs plus their sub-compounds do not improve
      the performances achieved with the longest NPs themselves. Adding
      sub-compounds to the longest NPs does not add much positive candidates and
      does not add candidates bearing enough information to improve the
      extraction.

      When applied to domain specific datasets, such as SemEval and DEFT,
      TermSuite candidates  lead to good performances.
      Section~\ref{subsubsec:candidate_extraction_result_analysis} stated that
      TermSuite candidates and longest NPs, which seem to be the best
      candidates, are not comparable. When they are used for keyphrase
      extraction, they seem competitive. Hence, a combination of these could
      contribute to the creation of an even better candidate set.

      The keyphrase extraction methods themselves behave differently. KEA have
      competitive performances with every candidate extraction methods while
      TF-IDF and TopicRank see their performances improving when the quality of
      the candidate set improves.
