- "I do not understand how the reduced set of candidates can result in higher recall values when the Rmax was not the best.":

Rmax in Table 3 is the maximum recall that could be achieved using a given candidate selection method while the recall values in Table 4, 5 and 6 are obtained after the candidate ranking. Here, a candidate selection that do not achieve the best Rmax can induce the best recall value if the selected candidate has a better quality. For instance, n-gram selection provides the best Rmax, but it selects so many unrelevant candidate that it makes the ranking step more difficult, inducing a lower recall value.

Again, thank you.
