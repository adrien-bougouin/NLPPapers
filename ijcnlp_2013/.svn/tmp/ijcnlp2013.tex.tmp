  \begin{abstract}
    This paper presents ClusterRank, a new graph-based ranking approach for
    automatic keyphrase extraction. ClusterRank's aim is to improve the coverage
    of a document's subjects by ranking them and extracting one keyphrase for
    each. The document is expressed as a graph representing its subjects and
    their semantic relations. Subjects are groups of similar phrases, they are
    ranked by significance and one keyphrase per subject is extracted and ranked
    by its belonging subject's rank. Evaluations performed using four varied
    datasets show a significant improvement against the state-of-the-art
    graph-based ranking approaches for keyphrase extraction on three datasets
    over four.
