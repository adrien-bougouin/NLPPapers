  \begin{abstract}
    Keyphrase extraction is the task of identifying single or multi-word
    expressions that represent the main topics of a document. In this paper we
    present TopicRank, a graph-based keyphrase extraction method that relies on
    a topical representation of the document. Candidate keyphrases are clustered
    into topics and used as vertices in a complete graph. A graph-based ranking
    model is applied to assign a significance score to each topic. Keyphrases
    are then generated by selecting a candidate from each of the top-ranked
    topics. We conducted experiments on four evaluation datasets of different
    languages and domains. Results show that TopicRank significantly outperforms
    state-of-the-art methods on three datasets.
