The paper reports the authors’ efforts in developing a novel unsupervised,
graph-based approach, TopicRank, for extracting key phrases from documents.
Noun phrases are extracted from texts as candidate key phrases and clustered
into topical groups. A document is represented by a complete graph in which
extracted topics become nodes and strength of the semantic relations between
topics is used to denote the weight of edges. An existing well-known measure
TextRank is performed on the constructed graph to rank the topics and identify
the key topic subset. In the end, the key phrase candidate that best represents
its group is selected from each key topic groups to form the final key phrase
set that captures the main topics of the document.

The novelty of the proposed method lies in two aspects: (1) The widely used
approach uses individual words to form the graph and extracts key phrases by
grouping adjacent words of key words identified by a graph-based ranking
measure. In this paper, by clustering noun phrases and constructing a graph
over the resulting topic groups, the redundancy of the graph is significantly
reduced. Therefore, key phrases can be extracted more accurately. (2) A
position offset-based measure is proposed to compute the edge weights that
represent the semantic relations between topics. This leads to the construction
of a complete graph that benefits the subsequent key phrase extraction.

The authors evaluated their approach on four datasets of different languages,
document sizes and domains. They also applied three baseline methods to compare
with TopicRank, including tuning one of the baseline methods using the settings
of TopicRank. TopicRank consistently outperforms other methods on three of the
evaluation datasets.

The paper is well written, and I would like to recommend it for publication if
the following comments can be appropriately addressed.

Major Comments

1.  The authors should provide a brief evaluation on noun phrase extraction and
topic clustering results

In this work, the topic identification component is fundamental to the success
of the key phrase extraction because the graph representation from which key
phrases are extracted is constructed based on identified topics. Noun phrase
extraction and topic clustering results deserve individual evaluations because
of the following potential problems with the proposed method:

(a) Noun phrase extraction

Noun phrase extraction is an open problem because of the existence of
coordination structures. While the authors extracted the longest sequences of
nouns and adjectives as noun phrases, ignoring conjunction part-of-speech may
lead to problems.  For instance, for the noun phrase“hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer”, the proposed approach will result in wrong phrases
“hereditary breast” and “ovarian cancer”, leading to a detrimental
effect on the subsequent process.

(b) Topic clustering

The similarity measure is crucial to the quality of clustering results. The
implemented criterion is based on “at least 25% of overlapping stems”.
Could you please provide some examples to explain “25%”? Also, stems
sometimes over-truncate strings. For instance, “activity” share the same
stem with “activation”, even though they are semantically distinct. Using
lemmas might be a better choice than stems here. Further, when clustering noun
phrases, the current similarity measure ignores the original contexts where
phrases are extracted. This might not lead to accurate topical groups. For
instance, the example presented in Figure 3 about “fuzzy”-related phrases
may be clustered into one group if their original contexts are considered.

A brief evaluation on some samples regarding the above two aspects should be
sufficient to provide a more in-depth understanding to the performance of key
phrase extraction.

2. The hypothesis of computing edge weights in Section 3.2.1 needs further
consideration.

The authors computed the edge weights based on the hypothesis “a strong
semantic relation if their key phrase candidates often appear close to each
other in the document”. This might work fine with concise short articles but
may not work well on longer documents. In a longer document, phrases that are
far away from each other in terms of offset position might not be semantically
distinct, especially when co-reference/anaphora is used. This partially
explains the authors observation in Section 5 “We conclude that it is more
difficult to treat long documents than short ones”. 

Some kind of paragraph-wise normalization within a document to formula (1) and
(2) could be useful. 

3. The explanation of Figure 3 in Section 5 is not clear.

The graph constructed by the proposed offset-based method is complete graph.
Why the examples shown in Figure 3 are not complete graphs? Why there is “a
deficit of connections” in the sentence “we observe that there is a deficit
of connections that leads to four connected components.” ?

4. The benefit of using complete graph representation is not obvious.

The authors claimed in Conclusion “The use of a complete graph better
captures the relations between topics and thus improves the ranking
performance.” However, this benefit is not clear. According to Table 3, when
SingleRank uses co-occurrence-based graph over topical clusters, it achieves
comparable performance to TopicRank across all evaluation datasets. It’s not
clear how much benefit the complete graph representation brings in. Also, does
complete graphs affect the speed of running TextRank?

5. The authors might want to distinguish TopicRank from Topic-Sensitive
PageRank.

Topic-Sensitive PageRank was developed by Haveliwala in 2002 as a topic-biased
extension of the original PageRank to extract documents that share common
topics with an input query. TopicRank works on single documents from which key
phrases are extracted.

Since both TopicRank and Topic-Sensitive PageRank contain a component derived
from PageRank, the authors probably want to mention Haveliwala’s work and
distinguish TopicRank from it.

Minor Comments

1.  In Section 3.2.2, even though TextRank is introduced in the previous
contexts, mentioning TextRank again here would be more clear to readers.

2.  In the third paragraph of Section 5, “The other datasets contain longer
documents, which may dampened this problem.” Is “alleviate” better than
“dampen” here?

3.  In the fourth paragraph of Section 5, “Those datasets are composed of
scientific articles where the main topics are often introduced at the beginning
and then, conveyed by abbreviations or inherent concept”,  “the full form
of the main topics” may be more accurate here than “the main topics”.

This paper presented an unsupervised method for keyphrase extraction. First,
the proposed method integrated many previous works for topic identification.
Then, the authors designed a graph–based model for topic ranking. Finally,
three strategies were used for keyphrase selection. The experiments on four
different corpuses in English and French show the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. 

The descriptions of the experiments do not seem to be overly strong:
1.        How dose the keyphrase golden line look like? Is it a phrase ranking
list or just phrase list?
2.        The keyphrase extraction is mainly based on the ranking model. It will
be better to show the order evaluations in the final results.
3.        What happens if the number of the keyphrases is changed?

Authors presented a graph-based topic ranking algorithm for keyphrase
extraction.  This is a well-written and an interesting paper. Evaluation showed
significantly better than state-of-the-art methods so far. There is a minor
typo in footnote 1 which missed the link of a dataset. I suggested authors put
all the data (and if possible, the source code) available to public.
