\section{Conclusion and Perspectives}
\label{sec:conclusion}
    This paper presented a new dataset for keyphrase extraction.
    Unlike any other dataset in the automatic keyphrase extraction community, our dataset includes extracted keyphrases with manual evaluations regarding two aspects: appropriateness and silence.
    Given that the current automatic keyphrase evaluation measurements is too pessimistic because they cannot manage subjectivity, our dataset or similar can be used to propose and validate new keyphrase evaluation measures.
