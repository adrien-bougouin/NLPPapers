\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion_and_future_work}
  In this paper, we presented a supervised extension of TopicRank. Using the
  SemEval corpora, we showed that combining common features and features related
  to the topical clusters significantly improves TopicRank and outperforms the
  most popular supervised method, KEA.

  This work showed that using clusters of topics ranked by importance can
  improve the performance of supervised methods. In future work, we plan to
  improve TopicRank's clustering and to explore topic labelling
  methods~\cite{mei2007topiclabeling,lau2011topiclabeling}.
