\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
  Since the last decade, the amount of information available on the web is
  constantly increasing. While the number of documents continues to grow, the
  need for efficient information retrieval methods becomes increasingly
  important. One way to improve retrieval effectiveness is to use
  keyphrases~\cite{jones1999phrasier}. Keyphrases are single or multi-word
  expressions that represent the main content of a document. There is, however,
  only a small number of documents that have keyphrases associated with them.
  Keyphrase extraction has then attracted a lot of attention recently and many
  different approaches were proposed~\cite{hasan2014state_of_the_art}.

  Generally speaking, keyphrase extraction methods can be categorized into two
  main categories: supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised approaches
  treat keyphrase extraction as a binary classification task, where each phrase
  is labeled either as ``keyphrase'' or ``non-keyphrase'',
  e.g.~\cite{witten1999kea}. Conversely, unsupervised approaches usually rank
  phrases by importance and select the top-ranked ones as keyphrases,
  e.g.~\cite{mihalcea2004textrank}.

  In the current state of the keyphrase extraction task, supervised methods
  outperform unsupervised methods. Taking advantage of statistical features
  (frequency, document frequency, etc.) and/or linguistic features extracted
  from training documents paired with reference keyphrases, supervised methods
  are able identify among candidate keyphrases the ones most likely to be
  keyphrases. In opposition, unsupervised methods only rely on the analysed
  document (sometimes using extra information) to determine the importance of
  each candidate keyphrase in regard of the document.

  In order to extract the most likely keyphrases without neglecting their actual
  importance within the analysed document, we present a work that combines both
  supervised and unsupervised visions of the keyphrase extraction task. Using
  the unsupervised keyphrase extraction method
  Topic\-Rank~\cite{bougouin2013topicrank}, we group candidate keyphrases that
  represent the same topic, determine the most important topics and apply
  machine learning to determine the most likely keyphrase of each topic.

  The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:background}
  gives an overview of previous work on keyphrase extraction,
  Section~\ref{sec:supervised_keyphrase_selection_from_topical_clusters}
  describes our new approach, Section~\ref{sec:experimental_settings} details
  our experimentations and Section~\ref{sec:results} presents the evaluation
  results. Finally, we conclude and discuss about future work in
  Section~\ref{sec:conclusion_and_future_work}.
