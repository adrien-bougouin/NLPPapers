\section{TopicRank}
\label{sec:topicrank}
  TopicRank aims to extract keyphrases that best represent the main topics of a
  document using both candidate clustering and graph-based ranking.

  At first, TopicRank clusters candidate keyphrases that belongs to the same
  topic. This topical clustering uses a ``naive'' stem overlap similarity: at
  the biginning, each candidate is a single cluster and candidates sharing an
  average of $\unitfrac{1}{4}$ stemmed words with the candidates of a given
  cluster are added to this cluster.

  Secondly, TopicRank builds a graph of topics and ranks the topic using
  TextRank~\cite{mihalcea2004textrank}. Every topic is connected to other topics
  by edges weighted according to the semantics strength between the connected
  topics. Then, TextRank ranking algorithm gives high importance to topics
  strongly connected to as most topic as possible and, additionally, important
  topics contribute more to the importance of the topics they are strongly
  connected to.

  At last, TopicRank extract keyphrases among the candidates of the $N$ most
  important topics. To avoid topic redundancy, only one keyphrase per topic is
  extracted. Following previous observations, the strategy to extract the best
  keyphrase of a topic takes its candidate that appears first in the document.
  This strategy is currently the weakest link of TopicRank.
  \newcite{bougouin2013topicrank} showed that the best best possible performance
  of TopicRank (with a ``perfect'' strategy) is be much higher than its current
  performance.
