\section{TopicRank}
\label{sec:topicrank}
  TopicRank aims to extract keyphrases that best represent the main topics of a
  document by using both candidate clustering and graph-based ranking. The most
  encouraging caracteristic of TopicRank is that its upper bound performance
  (its best possible performance) is much higher than its current performance.
  There is still room for improvement.

  At first, \TODO{explain the clustering}

  Secondly, \TODO{explain the graph-based ranking}

  At last, \TODO{explain the keyphrase per cluster selection strategy}
