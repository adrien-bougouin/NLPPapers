\section{TopicRank}
\label{sec:topicrank}
  \newcite{bougouin2013topicrank} proposed to extract keyphrases that best
  represent the main topics of a document by using both candidate clustering and
  graph-based ranking. First, candidate keyphrases that represent the same topic
  are grouped together, second topics are ranked by importance with TextRank's
  graph-based ranking algorithm~\cite{mihalcea2004textrank} and finally, the
  candidates that best represent each of the most important topics are extracted
  as keyphrases.

  At first, \TODO{explain the clustering}

  Secondly, \TODO{explain the graph-based ranking}

  At last, \TODO{explain the keyphrase per cluster selection strategy}

  \TODO{conclusion about the cluster ranking and the promising upper bound}
