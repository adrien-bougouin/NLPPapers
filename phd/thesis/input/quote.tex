  [\dots] if instead of having mass education as we now have --- must have ---
  with a curriculum, once we have outlets, computer outlets in every home, each
  of them hooked up to enormous libraries where anyone can ask any question and
  be given answers, be given reference material, be something you're interested
  in knowing --- from an early age, however silly it might seem to someone else,
  it's what you're interested in --- then you ask, and you can find out, and you
  can follow it up, and you can do it in your own home, at your own speed, in
  your own direction, in your own time, then everyone will enjoy learning.
  Nowadays, what people call learning is forced on you and everyone is forced to
  learn the same thing on the same day at the same speed in class. And everyone
  is different. For some it goes too fast, for some too slow, for some in the
  wrong direction. But give them a chance in addition to school --- I don't say
  we abolish school, but in addition to school --- to follow up their own bent
  from the start.
